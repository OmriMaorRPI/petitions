About
=========

PawPrints is a web application created by the RIT Student Government. 

Original Sources:
[Repository](https://github.com/ritstudentgovernment/petitions)
[Website](https://www.sg.rit.edu/)

The RPI Web Technologies Group has modified the application for use on the Rensselaer campus. 
The purpose of this site is to share ideas and influence decision making by posting petitions. The community votes on the petitions, and once a minimum threshold is reached, a response is issued by an appropriate representative or leader knowledgeable of the issue.
