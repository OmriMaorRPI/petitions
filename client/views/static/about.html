        RPI Petitions is the proud result of a collaborative effort between student leaders across multiple universities, with a common goal of increased transparency and collaborative communal activism.  This site is a Rensselaer-centric adoption of the Rochester Institute of Technologyâ€™s open-source PawPrints platform, encouraging students to participate in their community by creating, signing, and promoting their individual causes through a digital petition system.

        The Rensselaer Union 45th Student Senate, led by Grand Marshal Kyle Keraga '15, sought to create a system providing direct support for student concerns, thoughts, and ideas.  In Fall 2014, RIT's Student Government, led by Ashley Carrington '15, implemented PawPrints, an open-source petition website encouraging a stronger student voice and collaborative campus activism.

        In a unique collaboration between student governments, Keraga connected with Carrington to kickstart deployment of an open-source branch site for Rensselaer adoption.  Senate Chief Information Officer Gabe Perez '16 and the Web Technologies Group led all development through an extensive coding effort with a focus on remaining open-source and accessible, while Rules and Elections Chair Paul Ilori '17 spearheaded the creation of rules and procedures to govern the site's long-term use.

        RPI Petitions was formally released on March 18th, 2015. Any student is welcome to create a petition, advertise its presence, and gain support for their ideas.
